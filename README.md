This repository serves as an online home for my photography work, built as a microsite that can live both alongside and apart from my main [blog](https://reckart.blog). It's built in React and TypeScript and uses a very simple gallery/lightbox component structure to display my photos on devices of all shapes and sizes.  
### Commands
Output the static HTML, JavaScript, and CSS bundles into the `build` directory:
```sh
npm run build
```

Run a react development server that watches for changes and recompiles the bundle:
```sh
npm run start
```
